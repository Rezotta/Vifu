Hello, I'm Noctis, also known as Rezotta. I created the website "Vifu Checker." I'm using the VirusTotal API and Guzzle for easy HTTP requests.

# How to launch a project? 
you run the project on your hosting after installing php 8.1 or higher, as well as Guzzle (this is important for working with HTTP requests).
